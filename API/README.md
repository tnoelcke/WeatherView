# Front End

## Setup

## Running the app

## Description
The front end is what you would expect. Its what the user sees and interacts with. This will be done using  reactJS. This will be served using a NodeJS app. This will be a fairly simple application that will display data to the user in a nice color coded spread sheet like format. I would also like the ability to support graph type data display formats. However the initial focus of development will be the spread sheet like display format.
